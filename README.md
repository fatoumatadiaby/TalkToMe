Talk To Me app was designed to help people dealing with mental illnesses. This 
year i was diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety disorder and Depession. im fortunate enough to be able to receive full medicare coverage to see a thereapist and get the help that i need but allot of people i know dont have that same privilage so i wanted to create an app that provides resources and a safe place to express your thoughts and receive motivational comments from people who have either been through the same thing or experience the same thing.


* Rails version 6.0.3.2

* This app works by running Rails s in the terminal and typing  localhost9393 in the browser

* I am open to changes and suggestions.
